## Prerequisites: Installing Git

If you don't have `git` installed on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Git download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system.
3. Run the installer.
   - During the installation, you will be asked if you want to add Git to your system's PATH environment variable. Ensure you choose the option to do so. This allows you to use Git from the command line without specifying its full path.
4. After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and type `git --version` to ensure Git is correctly installed.

## Download
Clone the Git repo. Do NOT download it as ZIP, that won't work.

   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/Ahrimdon/test-repo.git
     ```
